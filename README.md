### Project Description
NUTRITRACK is a personalized nutrition assistant that helps users manage their health by calculating BMI and providing daily calorie intake recommendations.
It uses AI to suggest balanced meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner which are within calorie limits. Users can log their food intake, track calories, and compare it 
against their suggested daily goal of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

### The Problem Statement
Maintaining a healthy diet can be overwhelming, with many people struggling to track their calorie intake, choose balanced meals, and stay within their ideal nutrition goals. Without personalized guidance, it‚Äôs easy to fall into unhealthy eating habits.

We crunch the numbers for you, using your personal BMI to whip up a perfect daily calorie plan that fits your lifestyle like a glove. No more getting lost in confusing nutrition math or wondering if you're on the right track. Think of us as your pocket nutritionist, giving you clear, personalized guidance to help you rock your health goals.
